NAME
    Date::Japanese::Era::Table::Builder - conversion table builder for
    Date::Japanese::Era

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Japanese::Era 'Builder';

      # Sets the table up as JIS_X0301
      Date::Japanese::Era::Table::Builder::build_table(
        ["\x{660E}\x{6CBB}", 'meiji',   1868,  9,  8],
        ["\x{5927}\x{6B63}", 'taishou', 1912,  7, 31],
        ["\x{662D}\x{548C}", 'shouwa',  1926, 12, 26],
        ["\x{5E73}\x{6210}", 'heisei',  1989,  1,  8],
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used to define the conversion table used by
    Date::Japanese::Era, unfettered by concepts such as
    "post-gregorian-calender", "past eras only" and "factually correct".

    The module has three primary uses: The (far) past, the (far) future, and
    the (alternate) present, and was written as a writing aid when dealing
    with stories relating to future eras of Japan, although it's equally
    useful for quick conversion of old eras in a selected range, or
    accessing the calendar as it would look with alternate era names.

METHODS
    build_table
        The module has one subroutine:
        Date::Japanese::Era::Table::Builder::build_table(), which takes a
        list of eras in contiguous order of earliest to latest, each an
        array reference containing, in order, the proper era name, the ASCII
        era name, and the gregorian year, month and day that constitutes the
        first day of the era. (See example under SYNOPSIS.)

        When using this module, it is critical that this subroutine is
        called before any calls to Date::Japanese::Era, unless you really
        know what you are doing.
